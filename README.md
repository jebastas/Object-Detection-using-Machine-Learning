# Object-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

   Object detection using machine learning is a sophisticated computer vision technique that enables the identification and localization of objects within images, videos, and real-time streams. Leveraging advanced algorithms and opencv, this approach involves training models to recognize and classify objects present in visual data. 
      Through a multistep process encompassing data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, training, evaluation, and deployment, these models learn to accurately detect objects across various contexts and environments. Real-time object detection further extends this capability by enabling rapid processing of incoming frames, allowing for instantaneous identification and tracking of objects as they move within a scene. 
      This technology finds diverse applications in fields such as autonomous driving, surveillance, augmented reality, and industrial automation, where precise and timely detection of objects is essential for informed decision-making and intelligent system behavior.
